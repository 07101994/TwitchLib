# TwitchLib
A wrapper of the SmartIRC4net class intended for use with Twitch.
Also includes class to make async web calls to Twitch API.

This is still a work in progress. Basic functionality exists. 
You can connect to multiple channels, using multiple accounts,
and accept/send chat messages and whispers from multiple
Twitch accounts.

Now includes an example project demonstrating basic usage.
